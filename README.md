# JUnit & Mockito

## JUnit
A method can be consider as a unit. With JUnit we try and test a specific unit. The unit can be a single method, a group of methods or also a set of clases. The advantaje of unit testing is that once I write an unit test for a particular method I'll be able to run unit test automatically whithn milliseconds and check all the conditions for tthat particular method are matching or not (are passing or not)
